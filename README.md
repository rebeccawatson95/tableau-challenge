#### Project Background:
As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike Program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.
Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.
However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

#### Findings:
Using data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs, I found two unexpected phenomena. The first is where the higher volume of trips start and end at. I was able to view on a map where these are located and this data could be used to know where the bikes need to be at the start of the next day. This will help provide bikes in the most common areas. The second is which days of the week, as well as time of day, have the higher number of users. This is good to know as a driver on the street, or even as a Citi Bike user because there will be more demand at those times and availability might be low. With more time and possibly joining other data sets, these phenomena could be analyzed further.
